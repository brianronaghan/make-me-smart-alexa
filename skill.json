Marketplace hosts Kai Ryssdal and Molly Wood tell you what you need to know about the economy, pop culture, tech and current events. Each weekday we’ll explain one thing you need to understand – and why it matters. For example, you’ll find out how 5G works, what inflation is, why we have a 40-hour work week, and whatever happened to the $1000 bill. \n\nAll you have to do is say: “Alexa, make me smart!” \n\nAnd if there’s something you need to get smart about, tell us! Just say “Alexa, make me smart about…” and submit an idea for a topic. If we don’t have the answer, Alexa will relay your message to Kai and Molly, and we’ll get to work. \n\nCome back every day by saying “Alexa, Make Me Smart” and we’ll keep you up to date on the news of our fast-paced world!",
